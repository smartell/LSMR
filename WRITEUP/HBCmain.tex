\begin{abstract}
	A length-structured population model that incorporates mark-recapture data was developed to estimate abundance of humpback chub (\textit{Gila cypha}) in the Grand Canyon between 1989 and 2011. The model was fit to observations on catch-at-length and capture-recapture data from sampling programs that employed a variety of gear types including electrofishing, tramel netting, and hoop nets. Previous assessment models were age-based and have been shown to produce biased estimates of recent recruitment estimates. The age-structured model was also limited to data on fish that were greater than 150mm total length; the minimum size required for tagging. The length-structured model developed here makes no assumptions about age of individual fish and is also fit to catch-at-length data for fish that are too small to tag. Model outputs are based the number of fish greater than a specified size, or in a fixed size interval, there are no age-based results.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

In this report, I develop a length-structured mark-recapture model (hereafter, LSMR) where the accounting system for population numbers is based purely on length. The model is a statistical catch-at-length model, where the initial length distribution and recruitment each year are treated as latent variables to be estimated by fitting the model to a series of catch-at-length observations take over a period of time. A separable function is developed to estimate the year and size effect in observed catch-at-length data. The statistical nature of the model is very similar to that of \cite{fournier1982general}, but is based on catch-at-length rather than catch-age data. The model is also fit to length-based capture-recapture data, where the growth and survival of tagged animals is updated at each time step and the predicted ratio of marked and unmarked fish-at-length is used to estimate the length-based recapture rates.
